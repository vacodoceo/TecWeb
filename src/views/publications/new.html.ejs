<%# This special tag is an EJS comment %>
<%# And the one below is similar to the one we've been using to output values to the template's result %>
<%# but we cannot use the same one here since it automatically escapes HTML (converting <div> to &lt;div&gt;, for example) %>
<%# The one below, instead, will write its value directly to the end result, no escaping %>
<%- include('_form') %>
